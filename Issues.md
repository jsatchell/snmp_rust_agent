# Issues to MVP

* Privacy - Done
* Swap to Trie for Oid table
* Get-next
* Trait for OidKeeper, and sample Impl
* Change OidMap type to OidKeeper
* Set (for scalars only)
* Get-bulk
* Correct error response for simplest cases
* Table model
* Remote user support as example of table model
* Refactor into library plus example(s)

After MVP:
* more hash / cipler choices (at least SHA-256, AES-256)
* View model and user mapping to views
* Multiple contexts - separate Oid maps?
