# Security Policy

The team takes security very seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Supported Versions

Until the project reaches version 1.0, only the most recent version released on crates.io will be supported - the code is changing quickly, and many bugs are fixed from version to version.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.2.0   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory "Report a Vulnerability" tab.

The team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, 
and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. 

There isn't a tutorial yet on securing SNMP applications built using the framework, but there should be! There is an issue to write one before we get to version 1.0.
